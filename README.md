# Untitled ScriptGame - Remastered!
A Godot based game in which a player (Who is a hacker cracker cyber cyber) hacks the different objects throughout the game and changes their source code in order to move onto his next adventure.

## Remastered?
The original version of this game was never finished but a prototype was created!
Me and [@KfirGrizi](https://github.com/KfirGrizi) worked on the original and the repository got privatedðŸ˜³

So I took on myself to continue the game and keep the style, cant take credit for the idea as it's mostly Kfir's.

## Why?
I say why not?
Game development is one of my passions so I decided to continue on this.

## Can I join?
Sure! Poll requests are more than welcome!
